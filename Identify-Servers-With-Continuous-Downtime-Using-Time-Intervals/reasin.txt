I am contributing this question because it represents a realistic SQL pattern commonly encountered in production system monitoring and time-series analysis.

While I have not seen this exact question in interviews, I have implemented similar logic in real DevOps and monitoring environments to detect consecutive server outages, anomaly streaks, and repeated failures from timestamped logs. This closely mirrors real-world observability and alerting use cases, where identifying extended downtime periods is critical for incident response.

The problem teaches the classic “gaps and islands” pattern applied to temporal data and requires candidates to demonstrate proficiency in:

• SQL window functions (such as LAG and running SUM)
• Time-based interval validation
• Conditional grouping across multiple entities
• Handling real-world data imperfections, including missing timestamps and irregular gaps

Compared to existing LeetCode problems such as Human Traffic of Stadium (#601), this question introduces additional complexity through:

• Time-based consecutiveness using fixed 5-minute intervals rather than sequential IDs
• Multiple independent entities (servers) with separate grouping logic
• Duration calculations and explicit gap detection
• More production-relevant edge cases

I would classify this problem as Medium-Hard difficulty. It would be appropriate for SQL interviews involving Data Engineers, Backend or SRE roles with monitoring responsibilities, and senior analyst positions requiring advanced time-series querying skills.

Overall, this problem fills a gap in LeetCode’s catalog by focusing on practical, time-aware SQL patterns that are commonly used in infrastructure monitoring and analytics pipelines.
